# SSH Lite - Claude Code Workflow

This file documents how to regenerate the SSH Lite VS Code extension using Claude Code.

---

## IMPORTANT: Claude Code Rules

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES AT EVERY PROMPT:**

1. **READ this workflow file at the START of every prompt** - Before doing anything else
2. **UPDATE this workflow file** if there are any flow/feature/implementation changes
3. **NEVER forget these rules** - They are critical for maintaining project consistency
4. **DEBATE the user** if they request a feature that violates:
   - **LITE principles** (uses server resources automatically, polls, preloads without user action)
   - **Simplicity principles** (overly complex, too many options, confusing UX)
   - Push back respectfully and propose LITE/simple alternatives before implementing

---

## Project Overview

**SSH Lite** is a lightweight VS Code extension for SSH connections that works WITHOUT installing a VS Code server on remote machines (unlike Remote-SSH).

### Core Principles
1. **Simple and easy to use** - This is the MOST important principle
2. **No server installation** - Works via pure SSH/SFTP
3. **Auto-save credentials** - No complex credential management
4. **Lightweight** - Minimal footprint

---

## ⚠️ LITE PRINCIPLES (CRITICAL - READ BEFORE IMPLEMENTING)

**SSH Lite must be LITE.** The LITE principle has two meanings:

### 1. LITE Server Resources
Minimize server resource usage and SSH connections at all costs.

### 2. LITE UI/UX
- Easy to use, not complex
- Easy to understand at first use
- Minimal UI intrusion
- Non-blocking feedback
- Clear, intuitive actions

### Rules for ALL Features:

1. **NO automatic server commands** - Never run shell commands (grep, find, ls, etc.) automatically
   - ❌ BAD: Running `find` on every filter keystroke
   - ✅ GOOD: User clicks "Search" button to trigger server search

2. **NO polling/background refresh by default** - All auto-refresh features must be:
   - Disabled by default (interval = 0)
   - User must explicitly enable in settings
   - Use reasonable minimum intervals (>10s)

3. **Cache aggressively, fetch lazily** - Prefer local cache over server requests
   - ❌ BAD: Preloading 5 subdirectories automatically
   - ✅ GOOD: Load only what user explicitly expands

4. **Single connection per host** - Reuse SSH connections, never open multiple
   - Terminal, SFTP, and commands share the same connection

5. **Debounce user actions** - Rapid user input should not spam the server
   - Minimum 300ms debounce for any server-triggering action

6. **Opt-in expensive features** - Features that use server resources should:
   - Require explicit user action (button click, command)
   - Show clear indication of server activity
   - Be configurable to disable

### When Reviewing New Features, Ask:

1. Does this run server commands automatically? → Make it user-triggered
2. Does this poll the server? → Make it opt-in with default OFF
3. Does this preload data? → Make it lazy-load on demand
4. Does this open new connections? → Reuse existing connection

### Current Violations (FIXED):

- [x] Deep filter search runs `find` automatically → Fixed: Now user-triggered via "Search Server for Filter" button
- [x] Subdirectory preloading → Fixed: Disabled by default, controlled by `sshLite.enablePreloading` setting
- [x] Frequent file preloading → Fixed: Disabled by default, controlled by `sshLite.enablePreloading` setting

---

## 🧹 CODE QUALITY GUIDELINES

### Keep Source Clean
1. **Remove unused files/folders** - Delete files that are no longer imported or used
2. **Remove dead code** - Delete commented-out code, unused functions, unused imports
3. **Consolidate duplicates** - If similar logic exists in multiple places, refactor to share

### Logging Best Practices
Use the `log()` function to write to the output channel. Follow these rules:

1. **Log useful context** - Include enough info to trace errors
   ```typescript
   log(`Connecting to ${host.name} (${host.host}:${host.port})...`);
   ```

2. **Log errors with context** - Always include what operation failed
   ```typescript
   log(`Failed to list files in ${remotePath}: ${error.message}`);
   ```

3. **Avoid logging in loops** - Don't spam logs during iteration
   ```typescript
   // ❌ BAD: Logs every file
   for (const file of files) {
     log(`Processing ${file.name}`);
   }

   // ✅ GOOD: Log summary
   log(`Processing ${files.length} files in ${remotePath}`);
   ```

4. **Log state changes** - Connection, disconnection, file operations
   ```typescript
   log(`Connected to ${host.name}`);
   log(`File saved: ${remotePath}`);
   ```

5. **Point to error logs** - When showing user error, also log details
   ```typescript
   log(`Upload failed: ${error.message}\nStack: ${error.stack}`);
   vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Upload failed: ${error.message}`);
   ```

6. **Use log levels conceptually**:
   - Important operations: Always log
   - Debug info: Comment out or remove before commit
   - Errors: Always log with stack trace

## Key Implementation Details

### CredentialService (Multiple Credentials per Host)
```typescript
// Support multiple named credentials per host with pinned folders
interface PinnedFolder {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  remotePath: string;
}

interface SavedCredential {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  type: 'password' | 'privateKey';
  privateKeyPath?: string;
  pinnedFolders?: PinnedFolder[];
}

// API
await creds.listCredentials(hostId)  // List all credentials for a host
await creds.addCredential(hostId, label, type, value, keyPath?)
await creds.getCredentialSecret(hostId, credentialId)
await creds.deleteCredential(hostId, credentialId)
await creds.deleteAll(hostId)

// Pinned folders API
await creds.addPinnedFolder(hostId, credentialId, name, remotePath)
await creds.deletePinnedFolder(hostId, credentialId, folderId)
await creds.renamePinnedFolder(hostId, credentialId, folderId, newName)
await creds.getPinnedFolders(hostId, credentialId)

// Legacy API for backward compatibility
await creds.get(hostId, 'password')
await creds.save(hostId, 'password', value)
await creds.getOrPrompt(hostId, 'password', 'Enter password')
```

### HostTreeProvider (Expandable Hosts)
- Hosts are expandable (collapsed by default) to show credentials
- Connected hosts are NOT expandable (already connected)
- Child items: CredentialTreeItem (click to connect), AddCredentialTreeItem (+ to add)
- Click on credential to connect with that specific credential
- Credentials with pinned folders are expandable to show PinnedFolderTreeItem children
- Click on pinned folder to connect and navigate to that folder

### SSHConnection Authentication Flow
- If specific credential provided: use only that credential
- Otherwise (legacy): Try multiple auth methods
  1. Try configured private key
  2. Try default keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, id_ed25519, id_ecdsa)
  3. Try SSH agent
  4. Fall back to password (always included for keyboard-interactive)
  5. Handle keyboard-interactive auth
  6. On auth failure, clear saved credentials

### FileService Auto-Refresh
```typescript
// Single global timer, not per-file
private globalRefreshTimer
private isRefreshing = false

async refreshOpenedFiles() {
  // 1. Refresh focused file first
  // 2. Then refresh other non-focused files
}
```

### FileTreeProvider Navigation
- Track current path per connection: `Map<connectionId, path>`
- Show (..) parent folder item at top
- Commands: goToPath, goToParent, goToHome, goToRoot

## Configuration Options

```json
{
  "sshLite.connectionTimeout": 30000,

  "sshLite.uploadDebounceMs": 500,
  "sshLite.treeRefreshIntervalSeconds": 10,
  "sshLite.fileRefreshIntervalSeconds": 3,
  "sshLite.smartRefreshThreshold": 512000,
  "sshLite.largeFileSizeThreshold": 104857600,
  "sshLite.auditLogPath": "",
  "sshLite.tempFileRetentionHours": 504,
  "sshLite.credentialIndex": {}
}
```

## Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ssh2": "^1.16.0",
    "ssh-config": "^5.0.0"

## Regeneration Steps

1. Create new VS Code extension project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install ssh2 ssh-config
   npm install -D typescript @types/node @types/vscode @types/ssh2
   ```

2. Copy the project structure above

3. Ask Claude Code to implement each service following the patterns described

4. Key reminders for Claude:
   - Keep CredentialService SIMPLE (no profiles, auto-save by default)
   - File refresh: focused file first, then others
   - Navigation: track current path per connection
   - Always handle keyboard-interactive auth

## Testing

Press F5 in VS Code to launch extension development host.

  - Tests for CredentialService (add, get, delete, session credentials)
  - Tests for FileTreeProvider filter matching (plain text, glob patterns)
  - Run with `npm test`, watch with `npm run test:watch`, coverage with `npm run test:coverage`
- **Monitor Server now in Remote Files view**: Added monitor icon to connection items in file explorer
- **LITE-compliant real-time monitoring options**:
  - **Live Monitor Panel** (Recommended): Webview dashboard with manual refresh button
    - Shows load average, memory, swap, network connections, disk usage, top processes
    - User clicks "Refresh" to update (no automatic polling)
    - "Live Terminal" button to open htop for continuous monitoring
    - **LITE compliant**: User-triggered refreshes only
  - **Live Terminal (htop)**: Opens SSH terminal running htop/top
    - Fallback chain: htop → top → shell-based monitoring script
    - Shell fallback refreshes every 2s for minimal systems without htop/top
    - User closes terminal to stop monitoring
    - **LITE compliant**: User triggers, user controls, user closes
  - Original options remain: Quick Status, Diagnose Slowness, Watch (5s), List Services, Recent Logs, Network Info, Check Service
- **Orphaned SSH file handling**: When VS Code reopens with SSH files from a previous session
  - Files remain open as read-only (can view but not edit without reconnection)
  - "Reconnect to Server" button appears in editor title bar and right-click menu
  - Click reconnect → prompts for remote path → connects to server → enables editing
  - After reconnect, file is revealed in the tree and auto-upload on save is enabled
  - **LITE compliant**: No auto-reconnect, user explicitly triggers reconnection
- **Search improvements**:
  - Fixed search not finding text with special characters (e.g., `audio/ogg; codecs=opus`)
  - Search now uses `-F` (fixed string) mode by default for literal text matching
  - Enable ".*" (regex) toggle to use regular expression matching
  - Search panel UI improved: max-width container, collapsible include/exclude filters
  - Pattern inputs collapsed by default to save space
- **Live Terminal monitor fix**: Shell script syntax fixed for single-line execution
  - Fallback script now properly uses semicolons for single-line bash execution
- **Priority Queue for Preloading**: New PriorityQueueService for smart resource allocation
  - Five priority levels: CRITICAL (0), HIGH (1), MEDIUM (2), LOW (3), IDLE (4)
  - Lower number = higher priority, more connection slots allocated
  - **CRITICAL (0)**: Always executes immediately - never waits for a slot
  - **HIGH (1)**: Gets slot when ≥1 available (parent folder preload)
  - **MEDIUM (2)**: Gets slot when ≥2 available (frequent folders)
  - **LOW (3)**: Gets slot when ≥3 available (subdirectory preload)
  - **IDLE (4)**: Gets slot when ≥4 available (file preloading)
  - User actions (search, open file, navigate) bypass queue entirely - execute immediately
  - Preload tasks use queue with appropriate priority
  - `sshLite.maxPreloadingConcurrency` controls total available slots (default: 5)
  - **LITE compliant**: User actions never blocked, preloading is background work
- **Reconnect to Server improvements**:
  - Remote file path now persisted to disk (`.sshLite-metadata.json` in temp dir)
  - No more manual path entry - reconnect automatically uses stored remote path
  - Fallback to manual input only if metadata not found (old files)
  - Added "Reconnect to Server" option to tab context menu (right-click on tab header)
  - Works in: editor title bar, editor context menu, tab context menu
  - **LITE compliant**: User explicitly triggers reconnection, no auto-connect
- **Search trigger change**: Search now only triggers on Enter key or search icon click
  - Removed 300ms debounce on input - search text can be typed freely
  - Include/exclude pattern inputs also require Enter to trigger search
  - Toggle buttons (case sensitive, regex) still trigger immediate search
  - **LITE compliant**: Reduces server requests from accidental keystrokes
- **Live update file indicator**: Files being watched for real-time updates are highlighted
  - Eye icon with green color shows in file tree for watched files
  - Description shows `$(eye)` indicator next to file size
  - Tooltip shows "Live Updates: Active" status
  - FileService exposes `onWatchedFileChanged` event for tree updates
  - **LITE compliant**: Visual indicator only, no additional server requests
- **Loading spinner for file refresh**: Files being loaded/refreshed from server show spinner
  - Spinning sync icon replaces file icon during load
  - Description shows `$(sync~spin)` indicator
  - Tooltip shows "Loading from server..." status
  - FileService exposes `onFileLoadingChanged` event for tree updates
  - **LITE compliant**: Visual indicator only, no additional server requests
- **Search panel layout improvement**: Results section now spans full width
  - Only the controls section (search input, filters, scopes) constrained to 600px max
  - Results area fills entire panel width for better readability
- **Live-update highlight timeout**: Watched file highlight clears when connection lost
  - Heartbeat timer checks connection health every 3 seconds
  - For native watch: pings server if no activity for 10 seconds
  - For polling: activity updated on each successful poll
  - Highlight disappears automatically if connection drops
  - **LITE compliant**: Small stat ping only when truly needed (no activity)
- **Reconnect file reveal fix**: After reconnecting an orphaned file, tree navigates automatically
  - `revealFile()` now automatically navigates to parent folder instead of prompting user
  - Tree view reveals and highlights the file with focus after reconnection
  - No more "Navigate to File" dialog - navigation happens automatically
  - **LITE compliant**: Better UX with automatic navigation
- **Auto-reconnect on connection loss**: When VPN/network drops, SSH connections auto-recover
  - Connection loss detected via SSH close event
  - Auto-reconnect attempts every 3 seconds until successful
  - Tree view preserved during reconnection (cached data shown grayed out)
  - New `ReconnectingConnectionTreeItem` shows spinning icon with attempt count
  - Status bar shows reconnection progress
  - Manual disconnect (via UI) does NOT trigger auto-reconnect
  - New ConnectionState.Reconnecting enum value
  - `ConnectionManager.onReconnecting` event for UI updates
  - Credential preserved for seamless reconnection
  - **LITE compliant**: User initiated the original connection, auto-reconnect preserves intent
- **Fix tree item description icons**: Removed literal `$(sync~spin)` and `$(eye)` text from descriptions
  - VS Code tree item descriptions don't render codicons as icons
  - Removed these text indicators - the actual icon already shows the state
  - Description now only shows: file size and modified time
- **Eye icon shows for ALL open files in tabs**: Changed from single-file tracking to multi-file
  - Eye icon now shows for ANY file that is open in an editor tab
  - Not limited to just the active/focused file
  - Added `setupOpenFilesTracker()` to monitor tab changes
  - Added `onOpenFilesChanged` event for tree updates
  - Tabs are scanned via `vscode.window.tabGroups.all`
  - Updates on `onDidChangeTabs` and `onDidCloseTextDocument` events
  - **LITE compliant**: Only visual indicator, no additional server requests

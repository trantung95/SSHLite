# SSH Lite -- Planned / TODO

## FTP Support (issue #9)
- Add FTP as a second connection type alongside SSH/SFTP
- Reuse existing file tree UI (FileTreeProvider is protocol-agnostic)
- Transport: `basic-ftp` npm package (or similar)
- New: FTPConnection class parallel to SSHConnection, FTP host config type, auth (user/password, anonymous)
- No VS Code server required on remote -- fits the server-lite philosophy
